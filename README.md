This project is an email phishing detection system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Due to size limitations on GitHub, the two essential RandomForest models required for the functionality could not be directly uploaded alongside the project.

Additionally, to enable the seamless integration of the Gmail API for email processing, it is necessary to provide Google's Gmail API credentials. These credentials should be saved in a file named "credentials.json" within the project directory.
